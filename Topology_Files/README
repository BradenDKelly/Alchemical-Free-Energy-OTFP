This folder is meant to supplement the paper 

Alchemical hydration free-energy calculations using molecular dynamics with explicit
polarization and induced polarity decoupling: an OTFP approach
by Braden D. Kelly and William R. Smith

These folders contain parameter and basic geometry files for each solute molecule.

The partial charges in them are dummy values. Most likely HF/6-31G* RESP or AM1-BCC.

These files are not meant to supply the user with partial charges, only FF parameters.

If you have questions, after thinking at least semi-carefully about it, don't hesitate
to contact myself, Braden Kelly at bkelly08@uoguelph.ca. If you know any good jokes, feel
free to add them in the email. 

The parameter files were generated using Antechamber and acpype.

mobley_9534740 is (2R,3R,4S,5S,6R)-6 -(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydropyran-2,3,4,5-tetrol 
mobley_8052240 is 1-amino-9,10-anthracenedione
mobley_6198745 is  2,3-diacetoxypropyl acetate

There are some older molecular names that we used... call me old fashioned.
(Ben-Naim used the older names too)

Triethylamine is  N,N-diethylethanamine  in the FreeSolv database
Diethylamine is  N-ethylethanamine in the FreeSolv database
